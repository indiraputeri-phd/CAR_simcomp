  abstract = {An understanding of metropolitan spatial structure in property-value distribution is essential for international real-estate decisionmaking, yet knowledge accumulated in this area is limited because of data and methodology constraints. The author extends knowledge of the area by examining the spatial distribution pattern of housing prices (instead of the much-studied population and employment distributions) and two Pacific-Asia metropolises (rather than US cities or other cities in developed countries). Data were collected in Beijing, China, and Jakarta, Indonesia, from field reconnaissance surveys and interviews in 2000 and 2001. Digital terrain models were constructed for visualizing the property-value distributions. Profiles of the three-dimensional surfaces were extracted and curve-estimation statistics were used in a series of systematically selected geographical sectors in order to assess the intrametropolitan spatial variations. The findings suggest that neither of the two cities resembles a smooth surface featuring a cone, or the roof of a circus tent. Rather, Beijing's residential property value surface looks like a castellated rooftop, whereas Jakarta's resembles two television towers. The dynamic price terrains in the two cities are shaped by many factors, including their physical settings, history, and institutional frameworks. Intrametropolitan variations in property prices were remarkable in both cities. Properties in each of the systematically defined geographical sectors and in the history-development core show unique profiles and curvefitting statistics different from any other. The findings add to the existing generalizations and modeling exercises in the study of the internal structure of cities.},

Emerging Hotspot Analysis was then employed to classify price clustering across time. Key findings revealed significant spatial autocorrelation (\${\textbackslash}rho = 0.43\$) and temporal persistence best modeled by an autoregressive structure of order 2, indicating that market reactions to changes can extend up to six months. The results demonstrate the critical role of spatial and temporal factors in shaping property prices, providing actionable insights for policy interventions and real estate market analysis, particularly in addressing disparities between urban and rural housing markets.},

In multilevel analysis, the major restriction is often the higher-level sample size. In this paper, a simulation study is used to determine the influence of different sample sizes at the group level on the accuracy of the estimates (regression coefficients and variances) and their standard errors. In addition, the influence of other factors, such as the lowest-level sample size and different variance distributions between the levels (different intraclass correlations), is examined. The results show that only a small sample size at level two (meaning a sample of 50 or less) leads to biased estimates of the second-level standard errors. In all of the other simulated conditions the estimates of the regression coefficients, the variance components, and the standard errors are unbiased and accurate.},

The results yield information on both spatial and temporal variations in the processes affecting apartment prices and demonstrate the use of GWR for generating local spatial dependency measures which are conditioned on various covariates rather than being simple descriptions of pattern. The study utilizes a combined approach to account for both spatial dependency in housing prices and spatial heterogeneity in the processes generating those prices. The results suggest that there are spatial variations in the determinants of apartment prices and that these spatial variations are fairly consistent over time. The effect of the spatial lag on house prices exhibits strong spatial variation which again is reasonably consistent over time.},

Most existing studies have been conducted in the context of the West, where bus patronage is generally low.

Our findings are as follows. (1) Access to bus stops is positively correlated with property prices. This outcome is in contrast with findings of mainstream research (or conventional wisdom). For every bus stop within 500 m, the price of a property is 0.5% higher, all else being equal. (2) Bus travel times to essential destinations significantly influence housing prices. (3) Spatial econometric models that account for spatial autocorrelation outperform traditional hedonic pricing models. A few robustness check analyses further guarantee the plausibility of this study. However, the price premiums offered by bus accessibility may be gradually decreased, even eventually discarded, because of declining attractiveness for bus travel and continuous transit service enhancement in the forthcoming years.},

The spatial heterogeneity of the housing market determinants results in the spatial diversity of the market activity, as well as of real estate prices and values. The main aim of the study was to analyse an effect of these socio-demographic and environmental factors on average housing property prices and on the number of transactions in a spatial approach. In previous research conducted on a national scale, usually all variables were treated in a similar way, i.e., as global or local variables. During the research, an attempt was also made to answer the question of which of the variables adopted for analysis have a local impact on prices and market activity, and which are global. The study was conducted in Poland and used data from the year 2018 on 380 counties (Local Administrative Units). The study showed that determinants both for average prices and for the housing market activity show spatial autocorrelation with high–high and low–low cluster groups. Owing to these models, it was possible to draw specific conclusions on local determinants of flat prices and the market activity in Poland. The study findings have confirmed that they are an extremely effective tool for spatial data analysis.

The present paper argues the contrary, since many problems in the analysis of spatial data can be interpreted as problems of image restoration. Furthermore, the amounts of data involved allow routine use of computer intensive methods, such as the Gibbs sampler, that are not yet practicable for conventional images. Two examples are given, one in archeology, the other in epidemiology. These are preceded by a partial review of pixel-based Bayesian image analysis.},

This paper outlines the general class of Bayesian hierarchical models that can be implemented in the CARBayes software, describes their implementation via MCMC simulation techniques, and illustrates their use with two worked examples in the fields of house price analysis and disease mapping.},

This paper aims to investigate how different factors related to the location of a property affect its price over time. The predictive models applied in this research are driven by real estate transactions data of Tehran Metropolitan Area, captured from open data available to the public. The parameters of the functions that describe the behavior of the housing market are estimated through applying different types of statistical models, including ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR) and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR). This suite of models has been run in order to compare their efficiency and accuracy in predicting the variations in housing price. The GTWR model showed significantly better performance than OLS and GWR models, as the goodness of fit index (adjusted R2) improved by 22 percent. Therefore, spatio-temporal non-stationary modelling is significant in the explanation of the variations in housing value and the GTWR coefficients were found more reliable. Three internal factors (size of building; building age; building quality), and eight external factors (topography; land-use mix; population density; distance to city center; distance to subway station; distance to regional parks; distance to highway; distance to airport) influence the property price, either positively or negatively. Moreover, using significant variables that extracted from regression models, the optimum number of housing value clusters is generated using the spatial ‘k’luster analysis by tree edge removal (SKATER) method. Five clusters of housing patterns were recognized. The policy implication of this paper is grouping of Metropolitan Tehran housing value data into five clusters with different characteristics. The varying factors influencing housing value in each cluster are different, making this data analysis technique useful for policy-makers in the housing sector.},

Results show that the quality of basic educational resources has been capitalized in the surrounding housing prices and primary and secondary schools have significant school district effects. Moreover, “zero school choice” policy strengthens the effect of the school district and exacerbates the behavior of selecting a school by buying a house. Therefore, the simplistic educational policies pursuing equity, such as the “nearby enrollment” policy and “zero school choice” policy, cannot result in actual justice, but may exacerbate the division of residential areas in accordance with income and inequality of educational opportunities.},

In hedonic price modelling, a well-used method of estimating housing as a composite good, locational proxies such as postcodes or census tracts are often used to control for location. This notion of location is what geographers refer to as absolute location, a fixed position in space, as opposed to relative location, a position in space relative to other positions. In this paper, we look at the difference in explanatory power of absolute versus relative location in a hedonic model for apartment sales, using the city of Oslo as our case. The main finding is that the added explanatory power of postcode dummies significantly diminishes when introducing relative location explanatory variables such as walking distance to key places like the metro and parks. As house prices correlate with consumer preferences, these findings will have implications for urban planning insofar as different neighborhood designs vary with respect to their ability to harvest relative location potentials.},

  abstract = {Within housing literature, the presence of spatial autocorrelation (S.A.) in housing prices is typically examined horizontally in a two-dimensional setting. However, in the context of apartment buildings, there is also a vertical component of S.A. for housing units located on different floor levels. This paper therefore explores the determinants of both horizontal and vertical S.A. within residential property prices. First, we posit that S.A. in housing prices is a consequence of the price discovery process of real estate, in which property traders acquire price information from recent market transactions (i.e., comparables) to value a subject property. Furthermore, we contend that the extent to which property traders rely on comparables to determine housing prices is governed by the liquidity and volatility conditions of the market, which in turn affects the magnitude of the S.A. By developing and testing several spatial autoregressive hedonic models using open market transaction data for the Hong Kong residential property market, we find that market liquidity tends to increase both vertical and horizontal S.A., whilst market volatility is more prone to increase vertical S.A. but depress horizontal S.A.},

We review the spatial auto-correlation models used for areal data and disease risk mapping, and describe the corresponding Stan implementations. We also present a case study using Stan to fit a BYM model for motor vehicle crashes injuring school-age pedestrians in New York City from 2005 to 2014 localized to census tracts. Stan efficiently fit our multivariable BYM model having a large number of observations (n=2095 census tracts) with small outcome counts < 10 in the majority of tracts. Our findings reinforced that neighborhood income and social fragmentation are significant correlates of school-age pedestrian injuries. We also observed that nationally-available census tract estimates of commuting methods may serve as a useful indicator of underlying pedestrian densities.},

The research is based on a data set of 34,274 geo-coded apartment transactions for the years 2008–2015 in Warsaw. For data analysis the hedonic method was used in OLS, SAR, SEM and SGM models. Additionally we used DiD approach to address potential endogeneity. We found strong evidence that the new subway line (M2) in Warsaw influenced apartment prices even before it was completed. We observed a steady price premium adjustment process related to the new subway line. The findings confirm our hypothesis and are in line with previous research carried out in other parts of the world.},

abstract="Past applications of spatial regression models have frequently interpreted the parameter estimates of models that include spatial lags of the dependent variable incorrectly. A discussion of issues surrounding proper interpretation of the estimates from a variety of spatial regression models is undertaken. We rely on scalar summary measures proposed by LeSage and Pace (Introduction to spatial econometrics. Taylor Francis/CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2009) who motivate that these reflect a proper interpretation of the marginal effects for the nonlinear models involving spatial lags of the dependent variable. These nonlinear spatial models are contrasted with linear spatial models, where interpretation is more straightforward. One of the major advantages of spatial regression models is their ability to quantify spatial spillovers. These can be defined as situations where nonzero cross-partial derivatives exist that reflect impacts on outcomes in region i arising from changes in characteristics of region j. Of course, these cross-partial derivatives can be interpreted as impacts of changes in an own region characteristic on other regions or changes in another regions' characteristic on the own region. The ability to produce empirical estimates along with measures of dispersion that can be used for inference regarding the statistical significance, magnitude, and spatial extent of spillovers provides a major motivation for using spatial regression models.",
